      <h2>1. History</h2>
      <p>I am a simple c# and js developer who was asked to build an encryption website as an exercise to display my programming skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Encryption at the beginning sounds really scary but our class found a way to make it fun!

        <h2>2. Mission</h2>
        <p>I was able to create this application from the help of codePoint library and Twemoji library with their nice polyfill for backwards compatibility for older browsers since emojis are a somewhat new thing</p>
        <p>I am trying to perfect my problem solving skills in programming and apply them to other fields of my life. Whether that is other forms of engineering, finance or personal goals.</p>

      <h2>3. Vision</h2>
      <p>I hope you enjoyed this small biography of me and how encryption is supposed to be viewed as an "approchable" and "good" thing. Privacy is a big deal now that the internet has become what it is today</p>
      <p>I will do what I can in my life to contribute utility back to society either through my programming skills or passion for entrepreneurship</p>
